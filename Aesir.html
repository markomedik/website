            <h1>THE AESIR GODS</h1>
            <p>
                When referring to a group of deities that included both male and female
                divinities, the masculine plural “Aesir” was used. The second tribe was the Vanir, who are only
                nominally distinct from the Aesir; in Old Norse literature, the word “Aesir” is commonly used to refer
                to the gods as such, without regard for the nominal tribal distinction. Most of the best-known Norse
                gods and goddesses belong to the Aesir, including Odin, Thor, Frigg, Tyr, Loki, Baldur, Heimdall, Idun,
                and Bragi. Their home is Asgard, one of the Nine Worlds, which is located in the highest, sunniest
                branches of the world-tree Yggdrasil. In the Norse sources, Odin, the “Allfather,” is their
                chief.<br><br>

                The word “Aesir” is almost certainly derived from one of two Proto-Germanic words: *ansaz, “pole, beam,
                rafter,” or *ansuz, “life, vitality.” In either case, when this linguistic evidence is combined with the
                Aesir"’"s role in the tales of Norse mythology, it becomes clear that the Aesir were thought of as being
                the powers that hold the cosmos together, and prevent the giants from succeeding in their attempt to
                drag it back into the formless chaos from which it originally came. At Ragnarok, however, the gods are
                fated to fail, and the giants to succeed.
