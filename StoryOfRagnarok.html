            <h1>RAGNAROK</h1>
            <p>
                When Norse mythology is considered as a chronological set of tales, the story of Ragnarok naturally
                comes at the
                very end. For the Vikings, the myth of Ragnarok was a prophecy of what was to come at some unspecified
                and unknown time in the future, but it had profound ramifications for how the Vikings understood the
                world in their own time. We’ll explore some of those ramifications below.<br><br>

                The word “Ragnarok” comes from Old Norse Ragnarök, “Fate of the Gods.” In an apparent play on words,
                some pieces of Old Norse literature also refer to it as Ragnarøkkr, “Twilight of the Gods.” The event
                was also occasionally referred to as aldar rök, “fate of mankind,” and a host of other names.<br><br>

                The wolves Skoll and Hati, who have hunted the sun and the moon through the skies since the beginning of
                time, will at last catch their prey. The stars, too, will disappear, leaving nothing but a black void in
                the heavens. Yggdrasil, the great tree that holds the cosmos together, will tremble, and all the trees
                and even the mountains will fall to the ground. The chain that has been holding back the monstrous wolf
                Fenrir will snap, and the beast will run free. Jormungand, the mighty serpent who dwells at the bottom
                of the ocean and encircles the land, will rise from the depths, spilling the seas over all the earth as
                he makes landfall.<br><br>

                Fenrir, with fire blazing from his eyes and nostrils, will run across the earth, with his lower jaw on
                the ground and his upper jaw against the top of the sky, devouring everything in his path. Jormungand
                will spit his venom over all the world, poisoning land, water, and air alike.<br><br>

                The dome of the sky will be split, and from the crack shall emerge the fire-giants from Muspelheim.
                Their leader shall be Surt, with a flaming sword brighter than the sun in his hand. As they march across
                Bifrost, the rainbow bridge to Asgard, the home of the gods, the bridge will break and fall behind them.
                An ominous horn blast will ring out; this will be Heimdall, the divine sentry, blowing the Gjallarhorn
                to announce the arrival of the moment the gods have feared. Odin will anxiously consult the head of
                Mimir, the wisest of all beings, for counsel.<br><br>


                Odin will fight Fenrir, and by his side will be the einherjar, the host of his chosen human warriors
                whom he has kept in Valhalla for just this moment. Odin and the champions of men will fight more
                valiantly than anyone has ever fought before. But it will not be enough. Fenrir will swallow Odin and
                his men. Then one of Odin’s sons, Vidar, burning with rage, will charge the beast to avenge his father.
                On one of his feet will be the shoe that has been crafted for this very purpose; it has been made from
                all the scraps of leather that human shoemakers have ever discarded, and with it Vidar will hold open
                the monster’s mouth. Then he will stab his sword through the wolf’s throat, killing him.<br><br>

                Another wolf, Garm, and the god Tyr will slay each other. Heimdall and Loki will do the same, putting a
                final end to the trickster’s treachery, but costing the gods one of their best in the process. The god
                Freyr and the giant Surt will also be the end of each other. Thor and Jormungand, those age-old foes,
                will both finally have their chance to kill the other. Thor will succeed in felling the great snake with
                the blows of his hammer. But the serpent will have covered him in so much venom that he will not be able
                to stand for much longer; he will take nine paces before falling dead himself and adding his blood to
                the already-saturated soil of Vigrid.<br><br>

                Then the remains of the world will sink into the sea, and there will be nothing left but the void.
                Creation and all that has occurred since will be completely undone, as if it had never happened.<br><br>

                Some say that that is the end of the tale – and of all tales, for that matter. But others hold that a
                new world, green and beautiful, will arise out of the waters. Vidar and a few other gods – Vali, Baldur,
                Hodr, and Thor’s sons Modi and Magni – will survive the downfall of the old world, and will live
                joyously in the new one. A man and a woman, Lif and Lifthrasir (Old Norse Líf and Lífþrasir, “Life” and
                “Striving after Life”), will have hidden themselves from the cataclysm in a place called the “Wood of
                Hoddmimir” (Hoddmímis holt), and will now come out and populate the lush land in which they will find
                themselves. A new sun, the daughter of the previous one, will rise in the sky. And all of this will be
                presided over by a new, almighty ruler.<br><br>
