            <h1>Norse mythology</h1>
            <p>
                Norse or Scandinavian mythology is the body of myths of the North Germanic peoples,
                stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia,
                and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period.
                The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology and stemming from Proto-Germanic folklore,
                Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings,
                and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period,
                including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. <br><br>

                The source texts mention numerous gods, such as the hammer-wielding, humanity-protecting thunder-god
                Thor, who relentlessly fights his foes; the one-eyed, raven-flanked god Odin,
                who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet;
                the beautiful, seiðr-working, feathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among
                the slain;
                the vengeful, skiing goddess Skaði, who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore;
                the powerful god Njörðr, who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land;
                the god Freyr, whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity;
                the goddess Iðunn, who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness;
                the mysterious god Heimdallr, who is born of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth, and
                possesses a resounding horn;
                the jötunn's son, the god Loki, who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess
                Frigg's beautiful son Baldr;
                and numerous other deities.<br><br>

                Most of the surviving mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their interaction with several
                other beings,
                such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes, or family members of the gods.
                The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central sacred tree, Yggdrasil.
                Units of time and elements of cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a
                creation myth are recounted,
                where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask
                and Embla.
                These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnarök when an immense battle occurs
                between the gods and their enemies,
                and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There the surviving gods will meet, and
                the land will be fertile and green,
                and two humans will repopulate the world.<br><br>

                Norse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century,
                when key texts attracted the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe.
                By way of comparative mythology and historical linguistics, scholars have identified elements of
                Germanic mythology reaching
                as far back as Proto-Indo-European mythology. During the modern period, the Romanticist Viking revival
                re-awoke an interest in the
                subject matter, and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture.
                The myths have further been revived in a religious context among adherents of Germanic Neopaganism.
