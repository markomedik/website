            <h1>THE VANIR GODS</h1>
            <p>
                The Vanir are one of two
                groups of gods (the other being the Æsir) and are the namesake of the location Vanaheimr (Old Norse
                "Home of the Vanir"). After the Æsir–Vanir War, the Vanir became a subgroup of the Æsir. Subsequently,
                members of the Vanir are sometimes also referred to as members of the Æsir.<br><br>

                The Vanir are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional
                sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in
                the poetry of skalds. The Vanir are only attested in these Old Norse sources.<br><br>

                All sources describe the god Njörðr, and his children Freyr and Freyja as members of the Vanir. A
                euhemerized prose account in Heimskringla adds that Njörðr's sister—whose name is not provided—and
                Kvasir were Vanir. In addition, Heimskringla reports a tale involving king Sveigðir's visit to
                Vanaheimr, where he meets a woman by the name of Vana and the two produce a child named Vanlandi (whose
                name means "Man from the Land of the Vanir").<br><br>

                While not attested as Vanir, the gods Heimdallr and Ullr have been theorized as potential members of the
                group. In the Prose Edda, a name listed for boars is "Van-child". Scholars have theorized that the Vanir
                may be connected to small pieces of gold foil found in Scandinavia at some building sites from the
                Migration Period to the Viking Age and occasionally in graves. They have speculated whether the Vanir
                originally represented pre-Indo-European deities or Indo-European fertility gods, and have theorized a
                form of the gods as venerated by the pagan Anglo-Saxons.
